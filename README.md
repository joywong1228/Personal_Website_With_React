# Joy Wong's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website!  
This project is a living showcase of my skills, projects, and journey as a software developer.

## 🚀 About

I originally built a classic HTML/CSS version of this website as my first portfolio and learning experiment.  
After two semesters of intensive study—focusing on React, modern JavaScript, and deployment tools like Vercel—I rebuilt my personal website from the ground up.

This new version uses:

- **React** for a modular, maintainable codebase and interactive UI
- **Vite** for fast local development
- **Vercel** for seamless, sustainable deployment and updates

I designed it so I can easily update my information and projects as I grow, and so I can experiment with new tech skills as I learn them.

## 💡 Why This Project?

This website is both a portfolio and a learning playground.  
Every section, feature, and refactor represents a new skill—from basic HTML to React components, custom hooks, and cloud deployment.
